Creating SQL queries to analyze company data

In this assignment, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I will perform:


Data Modeling
Data Engineering
Data Analysis

Data Modeling entails:-

Inspecting the CSVs and sketching out an ERD of the tables. 


Data Engineering entails :-


Using the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Importing each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis includes: -

Once the database is complete then do the following:


List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
List employees who were hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
